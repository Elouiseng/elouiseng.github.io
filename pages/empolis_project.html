				<br>
				Every third semester of our curriculum, bib International College organizes an internship period during which all students pair up and apply to a company to work on a project requested by the company.<br>
				<br>
				My classmate Calvin and I decided to team up and work on a project together at a company. Through personal connections, Calvin secured a spot in a department of Empolis Information Management GmbH in Bielefeld. Although we were both studying to become game developers, we chose to work on a non-gaming software project.<br>
				After we completed the application procedure, Calvin and I started our internship on the 13th of February 2023. Our first day included meeting the team with whom we would be working for the next few weeks, a tour of the building, and receiving our key cards. For the remainder of the week, we familiarized ourselves with Scala — the main programming language of our department — and the company's internal coding guidelines.<br>
				<br>
				As mandated by bib principles, our first task was to create a Lastenheft, the initial specification sheet, for our client. After a meeting with our project supervisor to gather expectations regarding our work and our product during the internship, Calvin and I prepared a document outlining the specifications of our upcoming work. Spanning 28 pages, we provided detailed information including features, architecture, appearance, quality requirements, and test procedures.<br>
				Once we had completed this portion of our task list, we plunged into the actual development of the requested product. In addition to our programming work, we participated in all team activities such as daily scrums, sprint planning, and reviews. Calvin and I worked as efficiently as possible, having taken on a massive workload given the short time available. We each focused on the tasks that suited us best: Calvin handled the more complex aspects of programming the software's functions, classes, and methods, while I devoted my efforts to the user interface, documentation, and occasional research.<br>
				<br>
				These nine and a half weeks were rich with experience in every imaginable area. Not only did we learn unfamiliar programming languages — Scala and Angular — but we also learned how to work as part of team of programmers, create a usable application from scratch, and document our work professionally.
