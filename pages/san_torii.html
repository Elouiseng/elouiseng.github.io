				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">"The game “San Torii - Bound to Grief” was developed by the two classes “Game Design” and “Game Development” as part of a student project over the course of two semesters in 2023."</span><br>
				<br>
				This was my first game project where I worked in a real studio. Once a week, both classes met for a whole day - from 8am to 3:30pm - and we worked on the game together.<br>
				<br>
				The game designers had already started designing the project a month before and were ready to assign us to program it. I would say it was a bit more difficult for them because they had to change or redo a lot of things to make it work in practice. In theory, their previous work was fine, but when we developers started to bring the puzzle and level designs, as well as their assets, into a Unity project, we all ran into problems.<br>
				<br>
				The design of some puzzles just wasn't possible in Unity, especially with our skill level. Or they made no sense. In many situations, we developers sat down with the designers and changed their ideas into a working design. In my case, I was running after the people who were responsible for creating the assets because there were no consistent standards. Some sprites were too big, others too small, then the images I needed in black and white had color, or elements I needed to create animations in Unity with, were not well thought out. <br>
